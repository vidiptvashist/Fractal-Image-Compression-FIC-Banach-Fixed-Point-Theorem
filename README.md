# Fractal-Image-Compression-FIC-Banach-Fixed-Point-Theorem
With the advance of the information age the need for mass information
storage and fast communication links grows. Storing images in less
memory leads to a direct reduction in storage cost and faster data
transmissions. These facts justify the efforts, of private companies
and universities, on new image compression algorithms. Images are
stored on computers as collections of bits (a bit is a binary unit of
information which can answer “yes” or “no” questions) representing
pixels or points forming the picture elements. Since the human eye can
process large amounts of information (some 8 million bits), many pixels
are required to store moderate quality images. These bits provide the
“yes” and “no” answers to the 8 million questions that determine the
image. Most data contains some amount of redundancy, which can
sometimes be removed for storage and replaced for recovery, but this
redundancy does not lead to high compression ratios. An image can be
changed in many ways that are either not detectable by the human eye
or do not contribute to the degradation of the image. The standard
methods of image compression come in several varieties. The current
most popular method relies on eliminating high frequency components
of the signal by storing only the low frequency components (Discrete
Cosine Transform Algorithm). This method is used on JPEG (still
images), MPEG (motion video images), H.261 (Video Telephony on
ISDN lines), and H.263 (Video Telephony on PSTN lines) compression
algorithms. Fractal Compression was first promoted by M.Barnsley
The purpose of the image compression is to remove these redundancies
and thereby to reduce the size of the image to represent it for the
suitable application. Broadly, all the image compression techniques
are categorized as lossless and lossy. In lossless image compression,
an image is reversible and in lossy image compression techniques it is
irreversible. There are many popular image compression techniques
